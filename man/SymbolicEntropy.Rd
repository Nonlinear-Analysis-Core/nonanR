\title{Symbolic Entropy}
\usage{
SymbolicEntropy(x, thresholdVal, seqLength)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- A vector of integers}

\item{thresholdVal}{- the threshold of the search that you want to do}

\item{seqLength}{- the length of the sequence that you want to find}
}
\description{
Calculate the symbolic entropy of a time series.
}
\details{
Like all entropy functions, this one also quantifies the amount of complexity (or uncertainty/unpredictability) in the signal. Symbolic entropy can be used to gather greater insight into the underlying patterns seen in movement data.
}
\examples{

x = rnorm(1000)

thresholdVal = 2
seqLength = 0.2

SymE = SymbolicEntropy(x, thresholdVal, seqLength)
