\title{Bayesian Inference of Hurst Exponent}
\usage{
bayesH(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of time series}

\item{n}{An integer indicating the number of Hurst exponents to infer}
}
\value{
A probability distribution of the Hurst exponents inferred
}
\description{
Infer Hurst exponent of a time series based on accept-reject algorithm.
}
\details{
The Hurst exponent quantifies the temporal correlation among data points of a time series. This algorithm returns Hurst exponents with less variance compared to \code{dfa}. In addition, this algorithm is more robust to time series shorter than 512 data points. This algorithm estimates the Hurst exponent via Bayesian technique. Based on a predefined target distribution of Hurst exponent, an accept-reject algorithm is used to sample a posterior (probability) distribution of Hurst exponent. Common practice is to take the median of the probability distribution as the estimated Hurst exponent. For an example of using this algorithm on human movement data, refer to Likens et al. 2023.

\examples{
# Generate example time series data
x = fgn_sim(n = 128, H = 0.9)

# Run BayesH
h.pdf = bayesH(x = x, n = 200)

# Take the median of the probability distribution
H = median(h.pdf)
