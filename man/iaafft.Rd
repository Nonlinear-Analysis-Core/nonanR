Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform
}
\details{
Iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT) is an extension of the amplitude adjusted Fourier algorithm. IAAFT is used with surrogates allows the autocorrelation and power spectrum to be preserved from the original time series, along with the distribution. 

IAAFT is most commonly used in surrogate testing of data. Surrogate testing is a useful approach to identify evidence of nonlinearity by excluding a linear origin as a null hypothesis. This is done using a discriminating statistic (i.e. the result of some nonlinear function with a single output) like LyE or an entropy function. If the results from the discriminating are consistent, the null hypothesis is true however, if the original result is different from the surrogates, the null hypothesis should be rejected. 

The use of multiple discriminating statistics is encouraged and can help to eliminate any spurious results. Some caution should be taken if using IAAFT on shorter time series as it may not contain enough information to truly randomize.
