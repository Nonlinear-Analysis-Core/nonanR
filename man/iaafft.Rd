\description{
Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fast Fourier Transform
}
\details{
Iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFFT) is an extension of the amplitude adjusted Fourier algorithm. IAAFFT allows the autocorrelation and power spectrum to be preserved from the original time series, along with the distribution. 

IAAFFT is most commonly used in surrogate testing of data. Surrogate testing is a useful approach to identify evidence of nonlinearity by excluding a linear origin as a null hypothesis. This is done using a discriminating statistic (i.e. the result of some nonlinear function with a single output) like LyE or an entropy function. Failure to reject the null hypothesis occurs if the results from the discriminating statistics are consistent between the surrogates and original time series. If the original result is different from the surrogates, the null hypothesis should be rejected. 

The use of multiple discriminating statistics is encouraged and can help to eliminate any spurious results. Some caution should be taken if using IAAFFT on shorter time series as it may not contain enough information to truly randomize the time series.

\examples{
# Generate example time series data
n = 1000
H = 0.99
x = fgn_sim(n, H, mean = 0, std = 1)

# Create nine surrogate versions of x
surrogates = iaafft(x, N = 9)
